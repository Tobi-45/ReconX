## Network Scan

**Network Scan:** Perform a thorough network scan to detect hosts, services, and available ports.

**DNS/IP Scan:** Fetch detailed DNS records, IP information, and other related data.

## Reconnaissance

**Searchsploit Integration:** Query the Exploit-DB to identify potential exploits for vulnerabilities found.

**Encryption/Decryption & Hashing:** Utilize built-in tools to encrypt, decrypt, or hash data for verification and analysis.

## Additional Scans & Utilities

**Ping Check:** Verify availability of the target domain or IP.

**Directory Fuzzing:** Brute force hidden directories with the option for customized wordlists.

**Subdomain Scan:** Discover subdomains with fuzzing or wordlist-based techniques.

**API Endpoint Scan:** Identify and analyze exposed API endpoints.

**ID/Parameter Scanning:** Fuzz for hidden or vulnerable IDs and parameters.

**Password Cracker:** Perform password cracking for weak credentials.

**HTTP Header Analysis:** Extract and analyze HTTP headers for security insights.

**SSL/TLS Security Check:** Test SSL/TLS configurations and identify vulnerabilities.

**WAF & Security Detection:** Detect web application firewalls and other security mechanisms in place.

**Eyewitness Integration:** Capture screenshots of webpages for visual inspection.

**Shodan Integration:** Query Shodan API to gather intelligence on IPs or domains.

**Data Breach Detection:** Check if the target has been involved in known data breaches.
